# topic of the day is taking input in python
# input is a function which is used to take input from the user

# a=input("enter your name :")
# print("hello Mr.",a)
# input can also be taken in the form of integer or float

a=input("enter your name:")
print("hello Mr.",a)


# arthematic operations in python in correct way
# addition of two numbers
x=input("enter first number")
y=input("enter second number")
print(int(x) + int(y))

# it is a wrong method
x=input("enter first number")
y=input("enter second number")
print(x + y)  # this will concatenate the two strings instead of adding them
